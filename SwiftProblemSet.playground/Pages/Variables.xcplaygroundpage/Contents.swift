//: ## Variables
/*:
 ### Exercise 1
 
 For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - gallonsRemainingInTank (`Double`)
 - ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (`Int`)
 - birthplace (`String`)
 - myFirstProgrammingLanguage (`String`)
 */

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Make the minimal changes necessary to fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants.
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
let myFirstProgrammingLanguage: String = "C"
let birthplace: String = "Hoyerswerda, Germany"
var gallonsRemainingInTank: Double = 2.0
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks: Int = 32 // 32.45
let bestProgrammingLanguage: String = myFirstProgrammingLanguage

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared `stringToReverse` and `arrayOfCharacters` as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with `let`, no variables. **Note**: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.
let stringToReverse = "Mutable or Immutable? That is the question."
let arrayOfCharacters = stringToReverse.characters.reversed()
let reversedString = String(arrayOfCharacters)
/*: 
### Exercise 4

 For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

- an `Int` value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
- an `Int` value representing the score always required to win a game.
- a `String` value representing a student’s birthday.
- a `String` value representing what a user types into the status update area.
*/
var hungerLevel: Int = 0
let scoreToWin: Int = 1000
let studentBirthDay: String = "1977/11/12"
var userStatusText: String = "..."
